Building
--
To build, pull this repository into the ```package/``` subdirectory in the OpenWrt SDK with ```git clone https://github.com/probonopd/sunwait-for-openwrt.git```, then ```make V=s```. This will create ./bin/ar71xx/packages/base/sunwait_1.0-1_ar71xx.ipk (depending on your architecture).

Check the ```.travis.yml``` file to see how this is compiled on http://travis-ci.org automatically.

Using
--

The feature that makes this program slightly unique is that it can be set to wait specific event (such as 5 minutes before sunrise), then exit. This makes it useful for 'cron' jobs or 'scheduled tasks' when you want something to happen relative to sunrise, sunset, or some other astronomical event.

For example, consider this line from my crontab:
```
01 00 * * * sunwait civ start 38.794433N, 77.069450W ; br b6 off
```

This line executes at at one minute after midnight, waits until the start of civil twilight, then runs the command br ```b6 off``` (which turns off my carriage light).
